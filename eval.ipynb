      "\n",
      "Starting with the first letter: R. That's one 'r'. Then E, S, B, E, now we come to R again. Second 'r'. Then there's another R after that. So that's a third 'r'? Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Spelling out raspberry: R (1) - E - S - B - E - R (2) - R (3?) - Y. Hmm, wait, when I say the word, it's R-asb-err-y. The 'rr' in the middle. So that would be two 'r's next to each other. So the count is: first R at the beginning, then two more at the end? So total would be three?\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, when I spell it in my mind, it's R-E-S-B-E-R-R-Y. So that's six letters: R is 1, E is 2, S is 3, B is 4, E is 5, R is 6, R is 7, Y is 8. But letters with R: positions 1, 6, 7. So three R's. Yes, that's correct. But why do I have to check so carefully? Maybe I'm confusing it with another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is raspberry correctly spelled with three R's? Let me verify. Remembering the spelling, the first part is \"rasp\" and then \"berry\", but combined, the correct spelling is \"rasp-b-err-y\". So where the \"asp\" is part of the beginning, and then \"b-err-y\". Hmm, but maybe the double R is only in \"berry\"? But no,莓莓莓莓莓莓莓莓莓Berry is usually spelled B-E-R-R-Y, so with two R's, unless it's a different word. Wait, but then raspberry would start with R and then have the \"asp\" part, which doesn't have an R, and then \"berr\" would include two R's. So in \"raspberry\", how does that count?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I was incorrect earlier. If \"berry\" is B-E-R-R-Y, and \"raspberry\" is R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y, then the letters would be R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), B (5), E (6), R (7), R (8), Y (9). But wait, if \"rasp\" is R-A-S-P and \"berry\" is B-E-R-R-Y, then combining them as \"raspberry\" should have an extra B at the start of \"berry\"? Wait, no. The word \"raspberry\" is not \"rasp\" plus \"berry\", but it's derived from them, perhaps with some changes. Let's look at the components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the structure of \"raspberry\": It starts with R-A-S-P (which is a term related to a rough surfaced object), then B, then E-R-R-Y. But perhaps the B is part of the \"berry\" component? Wait, maybe it's better not to think of it as two separate words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, breaking it down, \"rasp\" is R-A-S-P and \"berry\" is B-E-R-R-Y, then combined as \"rasp-b ery\" with some merging. Wait, perhaps in between, but it's R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y. That way, the B is stuck in between \"rasp\" and \"erry\". But that's maybe overcomplicating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, just focusing on the R's: the first letter is R. Then after R-A-S-P, which has no more R's. Then comes B-E-R-R-Y, which includes R-R. So there's the first R at the beginning, then the next two R's in the latter part. So total R's would be 1 + 2 = 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, could there be only two R's? Let me check the spelling again. R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, that's the correct spelling. So R is first letter, then later two more R's. So total three. So answer is three.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, if I type raspberry right now, I'll see the number of Rs.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I'm trying to figure this out mentally, let me take another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is the word pronounced? In most accents, it's \"rasp-b-err-y\". The \"asp\" part doesn't have an R sound, then the \"b\" and \"erry\" which has a pronunciation like \"err\" with the R's. But in the actual spelling, before the \"E\" in \"berry\", there's a B. So \"raspberry\". So spelling needs to account for the B.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the key is in the spelling. So R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y. If I list the letters:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. R\n",
      "2. A\n",
      "3. S\n",
      "4. P\n",
      "5. B\n",
      "6. E\n",
      "7. R\n",
      "8. R\n",
      "9. Y\n",
      "\n",
      "So yes, three R's: at positions 1,7,8. Wait a second, seventh and eighth letters are R and R. So with the spelling R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y, yes, the sixth letter is E, followed by two R's. Let me check using letter counts:\n",
      "\n",
      "R (1) - A (2) - S (3) - P (4) - B (5) - E (6) - R (7) - R (8) - Y (9). Then R is in positions 1,7,8. So three R's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if someone forgets the initial R, they might think only two, but no, the initial R is part of it. Therefore, the total number of R's is three.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, could it be someone's name or a different word? For example, if it was \"berries\", that would be B-E-R-R-I-E-S. Then there are two R's. But in this case, raspberry is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in conclusion, there are three 'r's in raspberry. To check again: R-E-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y... Wait, actually, the spelling isn't R-E-S-P, it's R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y. The spelling is correct. \"Rasp\" as in the tool, and \"berry\" as in fruit. So when merged into raspberry, their letters combine accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct! So the answer is three R's. Should double-check once more. Let's recall \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" – that's the pangram, but here, focusing on 'r's in 'raspberry.' Let's write the word out again: R-A-S-P-B-E-R-R-Y. So, each 'R' is present once at the start, and then two more towards the end. Thus, the total count is indeed three. Therefore, the answer is three.\n",
