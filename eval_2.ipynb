      "Okay, so I have to solve this geometry problem where we have points O, A, and B on the coordinate plane. O is at the origin (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, √3/2). Then there's this family of segments F, which are all the unit-length segments from the x-axis (where point P is) to the y-axis (where point Q is) in the first quadrant. I need to find a point C on the line segment AB, not at A or B, such that this point C doesn't lie on any other segment in the family F except for AB itself. Then I have to compute OC squared, which equals p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a right triangle, since A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis. The coordinates suggest that triangle OAB is a 30-60-90 triangle. Yes, because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, OA is 1/2, OB is √3/2, so the hypotenuse AB would be (1/2)/cos(60°) = 1/2 / (1/2) = 1. Yes, that checks out because the distance from A to B can be calculated as sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is length 1, and OA is 1/2, so angle at O between OA and AB must be 60 degrees, and angle at B would be 30 degrees. Wait, actually, let's confirm the angles. In triangle OAB, the sides are OA = 1/2, OB = √3/2, and AB = 1. Since AB is the longest side, the right angle is at O. So angle at A is opposite OB, so sin(angle at A) = OB/AB = (√3/2)/1 = √3/2, so angle at A is 60°. Similarly, angle at B is opposite OA, which is 1/2, so sin(angle at B) = OA/AB = (1/2)/1 = 1/2, so angle at B is 30°. So yes, triangle OAB is a 30-60-90 triangle with right angle at O.\n",
      "\n",
      "So AB is the hypotenuse of length 1. Now, the family F consists of all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each segment is of unit length, with one endpoint on the x-axis (P) and the other on the y-axis (Q). So a segment in F can be parameterized by the coordinates of P and Q. Let's denote P as (a, 0) on the x-axis and Q as (0, b) on the y-axis. Since the length of the segment PQ is 1, the distance between P and Q is 1. So sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2] = 1. Therefore, a^2 + b^2 = 1. So all such segments are from (a, 0) to (0, b) with a^2 + b^2 = 1. Additionally, since the segments lie in the first quadrant, P and Q must also be in the first quadrant, so a ≥ 0 and b ≥ 0. But since P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, a and b must be non-negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, given point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. AB is itself one of the segments in F. Since AB is a segment from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, √3/2). Let's check if AB is indeed a segment in F. In F, a segment must start on x-axis, end on y-axis, length 1. So AB starts at (1/2, 0) on x-axis and ends at (0, √3/2) on y-axis. So let's check the length: distance from A to B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - √3/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is part of F. So the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that does not belong to any other segment from F. So in other words, every other point on AB except A, B, and C lies on some other segment from F. And we need to find the squared distance from O to C.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how can I find such a point C? Let me think. Suppose we have another segment PQ in F that intersects AB at a point C (not A, not B). Then PQ is not AB, so PQ is another unit segment from x-axis to y-axis. Suppose PQ goes from (a, 0) to (0, b) (with a^2 + b^2 = 1) and intersects AB at C. Then, C must lie on both PQ and AB. So we can find the parametric equations for PQ and AB and see where they intersect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps use coordinate geometry. Let's parameterize AB first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, √3/2), a parametric equation for AB can be written as:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = 1/2 - t*(1/2 - 0) = 1/2 - t*(1/2)\n",
      "\n",
      "y = 0 + t*(√3/2 - 0) = t*(√3/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, for a parameter t in [0, 1], point on AB is (1/2 - t*(1/2), t*(√3/2)).\n",
      "\n",
      "So if we let t vary from 0 to 1, we move from A to B along AB. The point C will correspond to some t, and we need to find a t such that this point is NOT on any other PQ segment from F. Since for most t, the point C will lie on some other PQ segment. But only at one such point C (distinct from A and B), does C lie only on AB and not on any other PQ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, wait. The problem states that \"there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB\". In other words, other than AB, this point C is not on any other segment in F. So our task is to find such a point C which is only on AB and no other unit segment from x-axis to y-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how to find that? Suppose we take a general point C on AB, not A or B. Then, for this point C, which is on AB and is (1/2 - t*(1/2), t*(√3/2)) for some t in (0, 1). We can write this as (1/2*(1 - t), (√3/2)*t).

Similarly, point (0,√3/2): same way, (0)^{2/3} + (√3 /2)^{2/3} = (√3 /2)^{2/3} = ( (3)^{1/2}/2 )^{2/3} )= (3^{1/2})^{2/3}/2^(2/3) )= 3^(1/3)/2^(2/3) ≈ (1.442)/1.2599 ≈1.144, which is more than 1.

So x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} for point B is 0 + (√3/2)^{2/3} ≈1.144 which is greater than 1. Hence, point B is outside the astroid. Therefore, AB enters the astroid at some point as it crosses from (1/2, 0) to (0, √3/2). Since at A, which is inside the astroid, and B is outside, by intermediate theorem, AB must intersect the astroid once at some point C. That intersection point would lie on AB and on the astroid, hence on only one segment (the tangent segment at that point). But AB is another segment. So that would be C.

      "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have points O(0,0), A(1/6, 0), and B(0, √35/6). Then there's this family F of unit-length segments with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant. We need to find a unique point C on AB (different from A and B) that isn't on any segment in F except AB. Then compute OC2 and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, finally find p + q.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me try to understand the problem. We have OA along the x-axis at (1/6, 0), and OB along the y-axis at (0, √35/6). Then AB is the line segment connecting A to B in the first quadrant. Then we are considering all unit-length segments with one endpoint on the x-axis (P) and the other on the y-axis (Q). So, these are segments of length 1 starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis. The point C is somewhere on AB, not at A or B, such that it doesn't lie on any other segment in F except AB. So, we need to show that there's a unique such point C, and then find the square of the distance from O to C.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, maybe I can parametrize the segment AB. Let's find the equation of AB. Since A is (1/6, 0) and B is (0, √35/6), the slope of AB is (sqrt(35)/6 - 0)/(0 - 1/6) = -sqrt(35). So the equation is y = -sqrt(35) x + sqrt(35)/6. The parametric equations would be x = 1/6 - t/(sqrt(35)), y = sqrt(35)/6 * t, where t goes from 0 to 1. Wait, maybe a better parametrization is using t as a parameter from 0 to 1, where when t=0, we are at A, and when t=1, we are at B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, coordinates of C can be written as ( (1/6)(1 - t), (sqrt(35}/6) t ) where t is from 0 to 1. Therefore, OC2 = ( (1/6)(1 - t) )2 + ( (sqrt(35)/6 t ) )2. But maybe that's for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's focus on the family F of unit-length segments with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. Let me parametrize such segments. Let P be (a, 0) and Q be (0, b), with distance between them being 1. So sqrt(a2 + b2) = 1. Thus, these are all the segments from (a,0) to (0, b) where a2 + b2 = 1. So F consists of all such segments in the first quadrant, lying along the unit circle in the first quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question states that the segment must lie in the first quadrant, so both a and b are positive. So 0 < a < 1, 0 < b < 1, and a2 + b2 = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a point C on AB might lie on some segment in F, unless it lies only on AB. So C is on AB, and if there is another segment in F that also passes through C, then C is on that segment. But the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment in F except AB. So that point must be unique, so when we have AB intersecting other segments in F only at A, B, and potentially this one point C.\n",

      "So the problem reduces to finding the intersection points of AB with all the segments in F, and there should be only one point C in addition to A and B where AB is the only segment through C.\n",

      "Wait, but maybe that's not exactly right. Because if you have a point C on AB, and if C is also on some segment in F, then unless that segment is AB itself. So for each segment in F, parametrized by (a,0) to (0,b) with a2 + b2 = 1, the segment would be the line from (a,0) to (0,b).

      "But perhaps solving in terms of coordinates: Let’s find points where the lines AB and the lines (from segments F) intersect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, any point on AB can be written as (1/6 - t, sqrt(35)/6 * t) for t from 0 to 1. Let’s suppose that such a point also lies on a segment from (a, 0) to (0, b) where a2 + b2 = 1.\n",

      "So AB itself is a segment with endpoints A(1/6, 0) and B(0, sqrt(35)/6), so it has the equation x/(1/6) + y/(sqrt(35)/6) = 1 or 6x + (6/sqrt(35)) y = 1.\n",

      "For these two lines, we already know they intersect at points A and B corresponding to segments where (a,0) is either A or B themselves? Wait. Wait, no. Wait, if the segment is from (a,0) to (0,b), where a is between 0 and 1, and b is between 0 and 1. But the problem says the segments must lie in the first quadrant. So when a = 1/6 and b = sqrt(35)/6, the segment AB is part of family F? Wait, is AB actually a part of F? Wait, AB has length sqrt((1/6)^2 + (sqrt(35)/6)^2) = sqrt(1/36 + 35/36) = sqrt(36/36) = 1. So AB is itself a segment in family F, from (1/6,0) to (0, sqrt(35)/6). So AB is already a member of F. So then problem says C is a point on AB that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So the lines corresponding to other segments from F (i.e., with different a and b such that a2 + b2 = 1) might also intersect AB at some other points, but there is one unique point C where AB doesn't intersect any other segments except AB. So, in other words, C is a point on AB such that the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. Therefore, there exists only one such point C on AB.\n",

      "Therefore, we need to find the point C on AB (distinct from A and B) which lies on no other segment in F. So for all other segments in F, their lines either do not intersect AB at C or intersect elsewhere. So to find C, such that the only segment from F passing through C is AB.\n",

The family \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) consists of unit-length segments with endpoints on the x-axis and y-axis in the first quadrant.\n",
