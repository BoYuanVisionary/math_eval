      "\n",
      "We have points O(0,0), A(1/6, 0), and B(0, sqrt(35)/6). The family F consists of all line segments of unit length where one endpoint P is on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So each segment in F is a unit-length segment connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment in F except maybe AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's visualize the problem. Points O, A, and B form a right triangle with right angle at O. The coordinates of A and B are given, so we can compute the length of AB. Let's compute AB's length:\n",
      "\n",
      "A is (1/6, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(35)/6). The distance AB is sqrt[(1/6 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(35)/6)^2] = sqrt[(1/6)^2 + (sqrt(35)/6)^2] = sqrt[(1 + 35)/36] = sqrt[36/36] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is a unit-length segment. That's interesting; AB itself is a unit-length segment from the family F. But the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, except for C lying on AB, all other points on AB might lie on some other segments in F? But C is the only one that doesn't. So, we need to find such a point C.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's parameterize the line segment AB. Since AB is from A(1/6, 0) to B(0, sqrt(35)/6), we can write parametric equations for AB. Let's let the parameter t go from 0 to 1, where at t=0, we're at point A, and t=1, we're at point B. So the parametric equations would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = (1/6) - (1/6)t = (1/6)(1 - t)\n",
      "\n",
      "y = 0 + (sqrt(35)/6)t = (sqrt(35)/6)t\n",
      "\n",
      "So any point C on AB can be represented as C((1/6)(1 - t), (sqrt(35)/6)t) for some t between 0 and 1. Since C is distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the problem is to find a unique point C on AB (so with some t in (0,1)) that does not lie on any other segment in F except AB. So, for all other segments in F, which are segments of unit length between some P(p, 0) on the x-axis and Q(0, q) on the y-axis, the point C should not lie on them, except for AB itself (which is a segment in F).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to rephrase, we need to find a point C on AB such that if any other segment from F passes through C, then that segment must be AB. Otherwise, if there's another segment in F that also passes through C, then C is not the point we're looking for. So, we need to find a point C on AB that is not intersected by any other segment in F except AB.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do we approach this? Maybe we can model all possible segments in F and see under what conditions a point C on AB is on another segment in F. Let's formalize this.\n",
      "\n",
      "A general segment in F is between P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), with length 1. So the distance between P and Q is 1:\n",
      "\n",
      "sqrt(p² + q²) = 1 => p² + q² = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since P is on the x-axis in the first quadrant, p ≥ 0, and Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant, q ≥ 0. So p and q are non-negative real numbers satisfying p² + q² = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the equation of such a segment would be the line from (p, 0) to (0, q). The parametric equation for this segment can be written as:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = p - pt,\n",
      "\n",
      "y = 0 + qt,\n",
      "\n",
      "where t goes from 0 to 1. So, any point on this segment can be expressed as (p(1 - t), qt).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, suppose point C lies on both AB and another segment in F. Then, there must exist parameters t (for AB) and s (for the segment in F) such that:\n",
      "\n",
      "( (1/6)(1 - t), (sqrt(35)/6)t ) = ( p(1 - s), q s )\n",
      "\n",
      "for some t in (0,1) and s in [0,1], and p² + q² = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, equate the x and y coordinates:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. (1/6)(1 - t) = p(1 - s)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. (sqrt(35)/6)t = q s\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to find p and q (with p² + q² = 1) and s such that for a given t (which corresponds to point C on AB), these equations are satisfied. But we need to find a t such that the only solution is when the segment is AB itself. In other words, for the point C on AB, if there exists another segment (different from AB) that also passes through C, then C is not our desired point. So we need to find a t where the only segment in F that passes through C is AB.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's suppose that for some t ≠ 0,1 (since C is distinct from A and B), there exists p, q, s with p² + q² = 1, such that equations 1 and 2 hold. Then, we need to find t such that the only solution is when the segment is AB, i.e., when p = 1/6 and q = sqrt(35)/6. So, we need to find t such that if equations 1 and 2 hold for some p, q with p² + q² = 1, then necessarily p = 1/6 and q = sqrt(35)/6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we need to find t in (0,1) such that the system:\n",

      "\n",
      "(sqrt(35)/6)t = q s\n",

      "\n",
      "has a unique solution (p, q, s) = (1/6, sqrt(35)/6, 1). For other t, there might be another solution (p, q, s) ≠ (1/6, sqrt(35)/6, 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, how do we find such a t? Let's try to express p and q in terms of t and s from equations 1 and 2, then substitute into p² + q² = 1 to get an equation involving t and s. Then, find t such that this equation has a unique solution for s (which should be s = 1).\n",

The family F consists of all line segments of unit length where one endpoint P is on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q is on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So each segment in F connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis and has length 1. We need to find a unique point C on segment AB (distinct from A and B) that is not part of any segment in F except possibly AB itself. Then compute OC² and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.\n",

The point C is somewhere along AB, not at A or B, and it's not on any other segment in F except maybe AB. So we need to find such a point C.\n",

      "First, let's parametrize segment AB. Let's find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A are (1/5, 0) and B are (0, 2√6/5). So the slope of AB is (2√6/5 - 0)/(0 - 1/5) = (2√6/5)/(-1/5) = -2√6. So the equation of the line AB is y - 0 = -2√6(x - 1/5), which simplifies to y = -2√6 x + (2√6)/5. Therefore, any point C on AB can be represented as (x, -2√6 x + (2√6)/5) where x is between 0 and 1/5. But since C is distinct from A and B, x is between 0 and 1/5, excluding the endpoints.\n",

      "Now, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So we need to find such a point C.

So the segment lies along the line from (a, 0) to (0, b), and any point on this segment can be written as (ta, 0) + (1 - t)(0, b) = (ta, (1 - t)b) for t between 0 and 1.\n",

Additionally, since the segment is of unit length, we have a² + b² = 1.\n",

That's important. So AB is a segment in F with P at A(1/5, 0) and Q at B(0, 2√6/5).

If C is a point on AB, then x = ta where a = 1/5, so x = t*(1/5). Similarly, y = (1 - t)*b where b = 2√6/5. Therefore, for AB, t ranges from 0 to 1, giving x from 0 to 1/5 and y from 2√6/5 to 0.\n",

So AB corresponds to theta where cos(theta) = 3/5 and sin(theta) = 4/5. Therefore, theta = arcsin(4/5) = arccos(3/5). Let's compute that angle. 3/5 and 4/5 are parts of the 3-4-5 right triangle, so theta is the angle whose sine is 4/5 and cosine is 3/5.

So, for any point P(a, 0) on the x-axis, the corresponding Q would be (0, b) on the y-axis such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt((a - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2) = 1, which simplifies to sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, so a² + b² = 1. Therefore, each segment in F corresponds to a point (a, b) on the unit circle in the first quadrant (since a and b are positive in the first quadrant).

Alternatively, parametric equations: x = 3/5 (1 - t), y = 4/5 t, where t ∈ [0, 1]. Then, when t = 0, we're at A(3/5, 0), and when t = 1, we're at B(0, 4/5).

The parametric equations for a segment from (a, 0) to (0, b) would be (a - a s, 0 + b s) where s ∈ [0, 1]. So, x = a(1 - s) and y = b s. Since a² + b² = 1, we can write these equations as:\n",

If P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, then the segment PQ would be connecting a point on the x-axis (P) to a point on the y-axis (Q), so it's a line segment going from (a, 0) to (0, b), where a and b are positive real numbers. The length of such a segment is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, since it's a unit length. Therefore, these segments are hypotenuses of right triangles with legs on the axes, each of length a and b such that a² + b² = 1.\n",

So, except for C, every other point on AB might belong to multiple segments in F. Wait, but AB is part of F, so any point on AB is part of AB. But maybe some points on AB are also part of other segments in F? For example, if there's another segment PQ in F that intersects AB at some point other than A or B. Then, that intersection point would belong to both AB and PQ. The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that doesn't belong to any other segment in F except AB.

      "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there's a family of unit-length segments F in the first quadrant.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB (which connects points A and B) that isn't part of any segment in F except for AB itself. I need to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and finally find p + q.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's parse the given points. O is at (0,0), A is at (3/7, 0), and B is at (0, (2√10)/7). So AB is a line segment from (3/7, 0) to (0, (2√10)/7). The point C is somewhere on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only such point that isn't contained in any other segment from the family F except AB. So my goal is to find coordinates of C and then compute OC squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me understand the family F. Each segment in F is of unit length, with one endpoint on the x-axis (P) and the other on the y-axis (Q). So if P is (a, 0) and Q is (0, b), then the distance between P and Q must be 1. So sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. Therefore, these segments are all unit-length segments connecting points on the axes. So the set of all such segments where sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, with a and b positive (since first quadrant). So each such segment is defined by a pair (a, b) with a² + b² = 1.\n",

      "Now, the problem is about finding a point C on AB that isn't part of any other such segment except AB. So AB is a specific segment from O(0,0) to A(3/7, 0) to B(0, 2√10/7). Wait, no. Wait, points O, A, and B form a triangle? Wait, O is (0,0), A is (3/7, 0), and B is (0, 2√10/7). So OA is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (3/7, 0), OB is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0, 2√10/7), and AB is the hypotenuse connecting (3/7, 0) to (0, 2√10/7).

      "The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that does not lie on any other segment in F except AB. So AB is itself a segment in F? Wait, let's check. AB connects (3/7, 0) to (0, 2√10/7). The length of AB can be calculated as sqrt((3/7)^2 + (2√10/7)^2). Let's compute that:\n",

      "\n",
      "First, parametrize the line AB. Let's find the equation of AB. Points A(3/7, 0) and B(0, 2√10/7). The slope of AB is (2√10/7 - 0)/(0 - 3/7) = (2√10/7)/(-3/7) = -2√10/3. So the equation of AB is y = (-2√10/3)(x - 3/7). Let's simplify that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, parametrize AB as a linear interpolation between A and B. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where at t=0 we have point A and t=1 we have point B.

      "\n",
      "So we can write the coordinates as C(x, y) = ( (3/7)(1 - t), (2√10/7)t ) for some t ∈ (0,1). We need to find such a C that does not lie on any other segment in F except AB.\n",
      "\n",
      "So suppose that there is another segment in F, say from P(p,0) to Q(0,q) with p² + q² = 1, such that C lies on that segment. Then C must satisfy the equation of that segment. The parametric equation of the segment from P to Q can be written as ( p(1 - s), q s ) for s ∈ [0,1]. So if C lies on this segment, then there exists an s ∈ [0,1] such that:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = p(1 - s) = 3/7 (1 - t)\n",
      "y = q s = 2√10/7 t\n",
      "\n",
      "But also, since the segment is of unit length, we have p² + q² = 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for a given C on AB (i.e., given t), we can check if there exist p, q with p² + q² = 1 and s ∈ [0,1] such that the above equations hold.\n",

      "So, solving for p and q in terms of s and t:\n",

      "From x-coordinate: p(1 - s) = 3/7 (1 - t) ⇒ p = [3/7 (1 - t)] / (1 - s)\n",
      "From y-coordinate: q s = 2√10/7 t ⇒ q = [2√10/7 t] / s\n",

      "\n",
      "[ (3/7 (1 - t))² / (1 - s)² ] + [ (2√10/7 t)² / s² ] = 1\n",
      "\n",
      "So this equation must hold for some s ∈ [0,1] for the given t ∈ (0,1). If for a particular t, there exists an s ∈ [0,1] satisfying this equation, then C(t) lies on another segment in F. The point C we are looking for is the one where this equation has no solution for s ∈ [0,1], except for the case where the segment is AB itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but AB is already in F, so for C to be on AB, we already know it's on at least one segment in F. The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So for all other points on AB, there exists another segment in F that also contains them. So C is the only exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we need to find t ∈ (0,1) such that the equation above has no solution s ∈ [0,1] except possibly when the segment is AB itself. So first, we need to figure out when the equation has solutions, and then find the t where it has no solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do we relate this to the segment AB? Let's note that when the segment is AB itself, then p = 3/7 and q = 2√10/7, and s would correspond to the parameter along AB. So for the segment AB, s would be equal to t, since in AB's parametrization, the parameter t goes from 0 to 1, corresponding to moving from A to B. Wait, but in the general segment from P(p,0) to Q(0,q), the parameter s is also from 0 to 1. So for the segment AB, p = 3/7, q = 2√10/7, and for a point C on AB, s would be equal to t. So when s = t, then the equations would correspond to the point on AB itself. But we need to consider other segments where s ≠ t.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for the point C to lie on another segment in F, there must exist some other p, q with p² + q² = 1 and some s ∈ [0,1] (different from t) such that C is on that segment. So for each t ∈ (0,1), we need to check if there exists a different segment (i.e., different p and q) such that C is on that segment. The point C we are looking for is the one where no such segment exists.\n",

      "Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this problem by considering the envelope of the family of segments F. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. In this case, the family of segments F are all unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis. The envelope of such segments would be the boundary of the region covered by all such segments. Points on the envelope are points that lie on exactly one segment of the family, which is the tangent segment. So perhaps the point C is on the envelope of the family F, and since AB is a member of F, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, parametrize by the intercepts a and b, with a² + b² = 1. So each segment is defined by a and b, with a, b > 0 and a² + b² = 1.\n",

      "Wait, let's go back. The confusion arises from the variables. Earlier, we had s as the parameter along AB and x as the parameter along PQ. Then, when we set up the equation for f(x), x is the parameter for PQ, while s is fixed. Then, we set f'(x) evaluated at x = s equal to zero to ensure that x = s is a double root. However, in the computation above, we fixed s = 3/4 and then computed f'(x) at x = 3/4, which is different.\n",

      "Wait, no. Let me clarify. In the original setup, we had s as a parameter along AB, and x as a parameter along PQ. Then, for a given s, we have the equation f(x) = 0, which is a function of x. To ensure that x = s is the only solution, we required that f(x) has a double root at x = s, which means f(s) = 0 and f'(s) = 0. However, when we computed f'(s) earlier, we were differentiating with respect to x, not s. Therefore, the condition f'(s) = 0 (derivative with respect to x) evaluated at x = s would ensure that x = s is a double root.\n",

      "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. First, let's parse what the question is asking. We have points O(0,0), A(5/6, 0), and B(0, sqrt(11)/6) forming triangle OAB in the first quadrant. Then, there's a family of segments F, which are all the unit-length segments with one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant. The problem states that there is a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that isn't part of any segment in F except maybe AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, so first, let's visualize the scenario. The family F consists of all segments of length 1 where P is (p, 0) on the x-axis and Q is (0, q) on the y-axis. So each segment in F is a line connecting (p, 0) to (0, q) with the distance between them being 1. The distance between P and Q is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, for any segment in F, we have p² + q² = 1. So all such segments are the hypotenuses of right triangles with legs p and q, lying along the axes, and hypotenuse length 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the point C lies on AB, which is a line segment from A(5/6, 0) to B(0, sqrt(11)/6). We need to find a point C on AB such that C is not part of any other segment in F except possibly AB itself. That means, except for AB, there is no other segment in F that contains point C.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to rephrase, we need to find a point C on AB such that there is no other segment in F (i.e., no other unit-length segment with endpoints on the axes) that includes C. Since AB is itself a segment from A to B, which are on the axes, but AB is not necessarily of unit length. Wait, let's check the length of AB first.\n",

      "Calculating the distance between A(5/6, 0) and B(0, sqrt(11)/6):\n",

So AB is itself a member of the family F. So AB is in F, because it's a segment of length 1 from (5/6, 0) to (0, sqrt(11)/6). So AB is one of the segments in F.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says that there is a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So C is on AB, and the only segment in F that contains C is AB. So if any other segment in F were to contain C, then that would violate the condition. So we need to find a point C on AB such that no other segment in F passes through C.\n",

We need to find the point C where such p and q do not exist (except for AB).\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, suppose that there exists another segment PQ in F that contains C. Then, C lies on PQ, so there exists some p and q with p² + q² = 1, and C is a convex combination of P(p, 0) and Q(0, q). So, C can be written as (1 - t)p, 0 + t*q) for some t between 0 and 1.\n",

So in AB, when parameterizing by s, the coordinates are (5/6*(1 - s), s*sqrt(11)/6). For PQ, parameterizing by t, the coordinates are ( (1 - t)*5/6, t*sqrt(11)/6 ). So actually, in AB, s corresponds to t in PQ. So when C is on AB, which is PQ itself, then s = t. So, when C is on AB, the parameter s in AB corresponds to the parameter t in PQ (which is AB).

      "Okay, so I have this problem here where there are points O at (0,0), A at (1/3, 0), and B at (0, 2√2/3). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that isn't part of any segment in F except maybe AB itself. I need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, and then find p+q.\n",

      "First, let me visualize the problem. Points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment from (1/3, 0) to (0, 2√2/3). The family F includes all unit-length segments with one endpoint on the x-axis (P) and the other on the y-axis (Q). These segments are all in the first quadrant. The key is to find a point C on AB such that C isn't on any other segment in F except possibly AB. Since AB is part of F? Wait, hold on. Wait, AB is a segment from (1/3, 0) to (0, 2√2/3). Is AB a unit length? Let me check.\n",

      "Compute the length of AB: distance between A(1/3, 0) and B(0, 2√2/3). The distance formula is sqrt((Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2). So Δx is 0 - 1/3 = -1/3, Δy is 2√2/3 - 0 = 2√2/3. Then the length is sqrt( (-1/3)^2 + (2√2/3)^2 ) = sqrt(1/9 + (8/9)) = sqrt(9/9) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is actually a unit-length segment itself. So AB is in the family F. So the problem says there's a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So C is only on AB and no other segments in F.\n",

Let P be (a, 0) and Q be (0, b). Then the length of PQ is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, so a² + b² = 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, a and b are positive. So any such segment is from (a, 0) to (0, b) where a² + b² = 1.\n",

      "First, let's parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts. We have points O at (0,0), A at (3/10, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(91)/10). The family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the segment has a unit length (so the distance between P and Q is 1). All these segments are in the first quadrant. Now, there's a unique point C on AB (different from A and B) that doesn't lie on any segment from F except possibly AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.\n",

      "Alright, so first, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a right triangle because O is at the origin, A is along the x-axis, and B is along the y-axis. The line AB is a hypotenuse of this right triangle. The family F are all horizontal segments of length 1 from the x-axis to the y-axis. Wait, no, actually, P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis, so the segment PQ is from (a, 0) to (0, b) where the distance between them is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. Therefore, these segments are line segments from (a,0) to (0,b) such that a² + b² = 1. So, all such segments where the endpoints are on the axes and the length is 1. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the point C is on AB, which is the line segment from A(3/10, 0) to B(0, sqrt(91)/10). So AB is a line in the first quadrant going from the x-axis to the y-axis. The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except maybe AB itself. So, we need to find such a point C on AB that is not part of any other unit-length segment from F. Then compute OC².\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's parameterize the line AB. Let me find the equation of AB. Since it goes from (3/10, 0) to (0, sqrt(91)/10), the slope is (sqrt(91)/10 - 0)/(0 - 3/10) = -sqrt(91)/3. So the equation is y = (-sqrt(91)/3)(x - 3/10). Let me write that out:\n",

      "Slope m = (sqrt(91)/10 - 0)/(0 - 3/10) = (sqrt(91)/10)/(-3/10) = -sqrt(91)/3. So the equation is y - 0 = m(x - 3/10), which gives y = -sqrt(91)/3 (x - 3/10). Alternatively, we can write it in parametric form. Let's parameterize AB from A to B. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1. Then, the parametric equations would be:\n",

      "First, let's check if AB is actually in F. AB is a segment from A to B. Let's compute the distance between A and B.

So, AB is one of the segments in F. Therefore, the problem says there is a unique point C on AB (different from A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is on AB, and the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. So, we need to find a point C on AB such that if you take any other segment in F, C is not on that segment.\n",

      "So, how do we approach this? Let's think about the family F. Each segment in F is a line segment from (a,0) to (0,b) with a² + b² = 1. So, any such segment can be parameterized as (a,0) to (0,b). The equation of such a segment would be the line connecting those two points.

      "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The problem is about a family of segments F, which are unit length segments lying in the first quadrant. Each segment in this family has one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other endpoint Q on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on the line segment AB (which connects points A(6/7, 0) and B(0, sqrt(13)/7)) that isn't part of any segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and finally find p + q.\n",

      "First, let me visualize the coordinate plane. O is at (0,0), A is at (6/7, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(13)/7). The line AB is going from (6/7, 0) down to (0, sqrt(13)/7). Wait, actually, since B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(13}/7)), the line AB is going from A on the x-axis to B on the y-axis. So AB is in the first quadrant, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "The family F consists of all unit-length segments with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each such segment is a line from some point (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1. Therefore, these segments are all the unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, in other words, every other point on AB except A, B, and C lies on some other segment in F. But C doesn't lie on any other segment in F except AB itself.

      "This is also complicated. Alternatively, perhaps assume that the point C is such that the tangent to the astroid at C is parallel to AB. Wait, but the tangent to the astroid at (cos³θ, sin³θ) has slope dy/dx. Let's compute that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parametrizing the astroid as x = cos³θ, y = sin³θ. Then dx/dθ = -3 cos²θ sinθ, dy/dθ = 3 sin²θ cosθ. Therefore, dy/dx = (dy/dθ)/(dx/dθ) = (- sinθ / cosθ) = - tanθ.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at (cos³θ, sin³θ) is - tanθ. The slope of AB is -3/4. Therefore, if the tangent to the astroid at C is parallel to AB, then - tanθ = -3/4 ⇒ tanθ = 3/4. Therefore, θ = arctan(3/4). Then, cosθ = 4/5, sinθ = 3/5. Therefore, the point on the astroid would be (cos³θ, sin³θ) = (4/5)^3, (3/5)^3) = (64/125, 27/125). Wait, but let's check if this point lies on AB.\n",

      "y = (-3/4)(64/125) + 3/5 = (-192/500) + 300/500 = (108)/500 = 27/125. Which matches the y-coordinate. Therefore, the point (64/125, 27/125) is indeed on both the astroid and AB. Therefore, this is the point C. Therefore, OC² = (64/125)^2 + (27/125)^2 = (4096 + 729)/15625 = 4825/15625. Simplify this fraction.\n",

      "Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 4825 ÷25=193, 15625 ÷25=625. So 193/625. 193 is prime? Let's check. 193 divided by 2,3,5,7,11,13: 13*14=182, 193-182=11, so 13*14 +11=193. 11 is prime. 193 is a prime number. Therefore, 193 and 625 are coprime. Therefore, OC² = 193/625, so p=193, q=625, p+q=818.\n",

      "Wait, but let me verify this conclusion step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I considered that the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1. Then, the intersection of AB with the astroid is the point C. Then, parametrizing the astroid and setting θ such that the tangent slope is -3/4, leading to tanθ=3/4, hence cosθ=4/5, sinθ=3/5, so the point is (4/5)^3, (3/5)^3) = (64/125,27/125). Then, checking that this lies on AB: yes, since plugging x=64/125 into AB's equation gives y=27/125. Then, computing OC² as (64/125)^2 + (27/125)^2 = (4096 + 729)/15625 = 4825/15625. Simplify: 4825 ÷25=193, 15625 ÷25=625. 193 is prime, 625=5^4. Therefore, 193/625 is reduced, so p+q=193+625=818.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, is this correct? Let me check another way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, suppose that the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Then, yes, the tangent at C to the astroid would have the same slope as AB. Therefore, the slope of the astroid at C is -3/4, leading to tanθ=3/4, as above. Therefore, the coordinates are (cos³θ, sin³θ) with cosθ=4/5, sinθ=3/5, so coordinates (64/125,27/125). Then, OC² is indeed 64² +27² over 125². Compute 64²=4096,27²=729, sum=4825. 4825/15625 simplifies to 193/625.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 193 + 625 = 818.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me verify once again. The problem states that C is a point on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, if C is on the astroid, then it's only on AB and no other segment. Because the astroid is the envelope, so points on the astroid are on exactly one segment of F. Therefore, the intersection point of AB with the astroid is the desired point C. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.\n",
